# rsa_sign_ring
This repo allows a prover to prove that it owns a valid RSA signature without disclosing its public key. Moreover, it allows
the prover to make a set membership proof of this RSRA public key (out of which one validates the signature). 
Hence, this protocol allows some sort of RSA ring signature. 

This repo has as only goal to evaluate a protocol. No throughout review has been made of the code nor of the protocol itself.
A description of the protocol is expected to come soon(ish)
